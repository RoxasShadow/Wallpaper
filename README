C# application that allows you to choose your wallpaper from the giant image database of Wallbase.cc.

You can set resolution, purity (safe for work and not) and the number of images to see at each request.

For each image, you can set it as background, see it in Wallbase.cc and just save it in your computer.

If you want to get the images from another website, just hack Wallpaper.cs.
